To build the project, make sure you have gradle (1.11 on my machine) installed and in your PATH.

If merely typing gradle gives you an error from this directory, it is likely that you have missed one or both of the required steps.

Assuming you have gradle installed and in your PATH, type 

gradle tasks

to see a list of available tasks

Type

gradle package

to build a war. You can find the war in the build/libs directory.
